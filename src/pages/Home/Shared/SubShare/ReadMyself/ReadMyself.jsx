          <h2 className="text-sky-700">Description</h2>I am Samsel Arfin, a
          recent graduate with B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from
          Green University, Bangladesh. I am a passionate web developer with a
          strong foundation in responsive-based applications and an appetite for
          continuous learning and growth.

        <hr /> <br />
        My core skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Firebase,
        MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, DaisyUI
        Framework, SQL, JWT authentication, and PHP. Although I may be
        considered a novice, I am actively engaged in a journey of continuous
        improvement and expansion of my development skills.
        <hr /> <br />
        I am proud of my portfolio of over 10 completed projects using React JS
        including Bistro Boss, a learning platform, kid toy shop, career hub and
        an innovative Ai affiliate bot for online income. Outside of web
        development, I have also ventured into AutoCAD design, UI/UX design,
        Photoshop and software testing, which showcases my versatility in
        development and design.
         <br />  <br />
        <hr />I have a commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement
        that motivates me to be a better developer and stay updated with
        technology. I want to become a skilled developer, making the most of
        every opportunity I develop as a junior developer and eager to apply my
        skills to real-world situations. With a growth mindset, I am ready to
        take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the world of web
        development.
